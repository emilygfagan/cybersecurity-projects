# Part 2 of the Honeytoken System: File Access Logging

This is where the honeyfiles become actual traps for unauthorized users. In this phase, I configure Windows File System Auditing so that any access to one of the honeyfiles will generate a log entry in Event Viewer and triggers alerts.     

### Step 1: Turn on File Access Auditing in Local Security Policy

### Step 2: Enable auditing on the honeyfiles

### Step 3: Test it by opening a honeyfile

### Step 4: Confirm access logs in Event Viewer
